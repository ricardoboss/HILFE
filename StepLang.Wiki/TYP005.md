# Variable Already Declared Exception

## Description

This exception is thrown when a variable is declared more than once in the same scope.

Example:

```step
number a = 1

number a = 2
```

## Remediation

Make sure that each variable is only declared once in each scope or give each variable a different name.

```diff
  number a = 1
- number a = 2
+ number b = 2
```

## Tip

You can use anonymous code blocks to separate different scopes.

This is valid:

```step
number a = 1

{
  number a = 2
}
```
