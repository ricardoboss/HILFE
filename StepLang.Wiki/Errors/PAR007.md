# Imports No Longer Allowed Exception

## Description

All `import` statements must be at the top of the file.
After the first non-import statement, no more imports are allowed.

Only comments and whitespace are allowed before and between import statements.

Example:

```step
// this is a comment
import "somefile.step"

var x = 1

import "someotherfile.step"
```

## Remediation

Move all imports to the top of the file.

Example:

```diff
  // this is a comment
  import "somefile.step"
+ import "someotherfile.step"

  var x = 1

- import "someotherfile.step"
```
