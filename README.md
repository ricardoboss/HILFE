Behold, a new programming language arrives:

```step
number pi = 3.141592

string name = "John"
if (name == "John") {
    println("Hello, ", name)
} else {
    println("Who are you?")
}

string guess
number parsedGuess
number tries = 0
while (tries <= 3) {
    print("Guess PI: ")
    guess = readline()
    parsedGuess = parse("number", guess)
    if (parsedGuess == null) {
        println("Enter a valid number!")

        tries++

        continue
    }

    if (parsedGuess == pi) {
        println("Close enough!")
        break
    } else {
        if (parsedGuess > 4 || parsedGuess < 3) {
            println("Way off! ", 3 - tries, " tries left.")
        } else {
            println("Nope, try again. ", 3 - tries, " tries left.")
        }
    }

    tries++
}

print("Goodbye", EOL)
```

## What is this?

This repository contains an interpreter and command line interface for the STEP programming language.

## What is STEP?

STEP is a programming language designed to be simple and easy to learn.
Is is a statically typed language with a C-like syntax.

## Why is this?

The main reason this exists is because I want to learn about programming languages and how they are designed.
Another reason was my desire to create a language that can be taught to people who have never programmed before.

## What does it do better than other languages?

It uses very little keywords and not many symbols, so new programmers can focus on the important stuff.
Like many other languages, it also uses C-like syntax, which is very common and prepares new programmers for other,
more advanced languages.

## How can I learn it?

Take a look at the [`STEP/Examples`](./STEP/Examples) folder.
It contains a few examples of STEP code, which you can run using the interpreter.

## Can I contribute?

Sure, open a PR with your feature and corresponding tests.
If it's something I want to develop myself however, I might not merge it.
This is because, well, I want to learn it myself.

## Are you going to maintain it?

It's just a small project to learn about programming languages.
If there are bugs, I'll try to fix them, but I'm not promising new features or anything like that.
